    "This sort of data is convenient for machine learning because most models, such as neural networks, also expect incoming data to be of fixed dimensions. Real-world information is not always so tabular.  Consider if the rows represent customers.  These people might have multiple phone numbers and addresses.  How would you describe such data using a fixed number of columns?  It would be useful to have a list of these courses in each row that can be of a variable length for each row, or student.\n",

    "JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a standard file format that stores data in a hierarchical format similar to eXtensible Markup Language (XML).  JSON is nothing more than a hierarchy of lists and dictionaries.  Programmers refer to this sort of data as semi-structured data or hierarchical data.  The following is a sample JSON file.\n",
